<h2>My Past</h2>
<img class="left" src="images/anna.rachel.jpg" alt="Anna and Rachel">
<p>I have not gone very far in my lifetime. When I was younger i lived in the city of Mauldin, in a huge house. When i was about four years old I moved into an apartment until my new house in Greer was Built. I moved into my brand new house at around four, and honestly do not remember much of the move. I atteneded <a href="http://www.southsidechristian.org/">Southside Christian School</a> for most of my early years of childhood. At about 7 years of age, I moved to Woodland ELementary School through 5th grade. For Middle School, I attended Langston Charter Middle School. Middle school was great for me, and i loved my school and all of my teachers all three years. My childhood was pretty great, because i had a family and siblings who took care of me and loved me.</p>

<p>I am currently a sophomore at JL Mann High school. I have two siblings one a senior in high school at JL Mann and one a Junior at Clemson University. Both of my parents have their self owned business which is called <a href="https://riverstoneway.wordpress.com/">Riverstone Organizational Advisors</a> I have two dogs, which are yorkie poos, named max and cody. I am really close to all of my family and i'm not sure what i would do without them. I live in Greer South Carolina, and all of my friends live close by me, which is convenient.</p>
<p>I enjoy to be involved with many things, and balance a social life at the same time. I am extremely involved with the Youth in Government Program. I have done YIG  since 6th grade, and have attended over 20 other conferences since then. I love to do these conferences and they are the most look forward to things of the year. This past summer I went to CONA which is a conference on national affairs, and learned so many new things from that conferencE. My love for speech and debate stems from being able to do Yig, by which i am very thankful of. I also love to go outdoors, and hike, and go to the lake, and go camping, and in the winter go skiing. I have been doing outdoorsy things every since i was young, and will continue to for a long time. I also love to dance. I was a competitive dancer for 8 years, but had to quit last year due to an expense on my time and money. Now, i have found Swing dancing which is every wednesday night, and it is dancing brought back to older times. It's so much fun and one of my favorite things to do. Finally, my other favorite thing to do is Downtown with my friends. I could go all day to Downtown Greenville, because there are so many different things you can do.</p>
